                        Dec 21, 2019
                        It is expected that the country's dependence on edible oil imports will increase further as heavy rains damaged soybean crops
                        and a lower than expected.</a>

                <a href="">There are not all that many turkeys in India â€“ 4,23,374 in the census, 
                    compared to 80.78 crore chickens. But this represents a whopping 66.8% increase over 2012, 
                    so clearly more people, particularly in Assam, are raising turkeys. Manipur, 
                    Nagaland and Tripura also have relatively high numbers of turkeys.</a>

                    The exporters rue that the consignments were stranded on Indian ports after the notification 
                    issued on November 4 by the Indian Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) 
                    mandated all shipments headed to Europe as well as CIS countries to get
                        Certificate of Inspection from Export Inspection Council (EIC) fulfilling the EU norms.</a>
